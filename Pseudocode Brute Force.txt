
Pseudocode for Brute Force Method:

	IF M is the number of keys
	  set of keys [0...M+2}
	    position of keys [0...M+2]
        FOR i = 1 to M
	  IF keys[i] = 1
	   set of keys [j] = position of keys[j] = keys[i]
		j++
	         j = 0
       FOR j = 1 TO T
	  IF  set of keys[j] - balls[i] less than the set of keys[j+1] - ball[i]
		minSum = minSum + the set of keys[j] - balls[i]
		  the position of keys[j] = balls[i]
	  ELSE minSum = minSum + the set of keys[j+1] - balls[i]
	  the position of keys[j+1] = max of balls[i] and the subset of keys[i+1]
	   
	WHILE loop balls[i+1] less or equal than the set of keys[j+1]
	INCREMENT i;
      INCREMENT j;
	
return minSum;
